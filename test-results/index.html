    <main>
      <p>
        This document compares the capabilities of SVG in popular screen reader and browser combinations. The tests
        represented cover basic SVG support with screen readers (a kind of <i>Assistive Technology</i> or <i>AT</i>),
        and comparison and contrast with ARIA behavior in SVG vs equivalent structures in HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to identify instances where SVG differs from HTML, or from the behavior specified in the relevant
        SVG or WAI-ARIA specifications. Once issues are identified, we can determine whether the problem originates in
        the screen reader, the browser, the operating systems accessibility APIs, or some combination.
      </p>

      <p>Once the issue and the responsible software is identified, we can work to get that behavior changed.</p>

      <p>
        In some cases, the behavior may work correctly as directed in the relevant specification, but may lead to
        suboptimal authoring or reading experiences. In other cases, the behavior may be underspecified, and thus need
        better specification to provide interoperable authoring and reading experiences across all screen reader,
        browser, and operating systems.
      </p>

      <p>TODO: explain why consistent SVG behavior is needed. Talk about regression bugs.</p>

      <p>
        The tables in this document are dynamically generated from a JSON file,
        <a href="data/svg-a11y-tests.json">svg-a11y-tests.json</a>, which is a summary of the detailed issue reports.
        This JSON file is intended to provide up-to-date test results in a reader-friendly presentation, but requires
        that client-side JavaScript is enabled.

        <h2 id="implementations">Implementations</h2>
        <p>
          In order to sample the most common and representative screen-reader, browser, and operating system
          combinations, we referenced the
          <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#browsercombos">2021 WebAim Screen Reader Survey</a>.
          We selected a subset of combinations that balanced the reported frequency of combinations across all screen
          readers, browser engines, and operating systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Notably, we did not include <b>JAWS with Edge</b> or <b>JAWS with Firefox</b>, even though they are more
          commonly used than <b>Voiceover with Safari</b>. We reasoned that since Microsoft Edge uses the same
          underlying browser engine as Google Chrome, they would likely have the same behavior with screen readers. For
          budgetary reasons, we prioritized Voiceover with Safari on MacOS over JAWS with Firefox on Windows, since we
          wanted to have iOS represented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note: We felt it was especially important to show the results of Voiceover, since its behavior with SVG and
          ARIA conforms most closely to the specifications.
